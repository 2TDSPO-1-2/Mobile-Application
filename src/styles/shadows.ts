 * Cross-platform equivalents of the web's shadow-sm/shadow-md.
 *
 * Native (iOS reads `shadow*`, Android reads `elevation` — both live on the
 * same object and each platform ignores what it doesn't understand) keeps
 * the original RN shadow props. Web is handled separately: React Native
 * Web logs "shadow* style props are deprecated. Use boxShadow." because it
 * maps CSS `box-shadow` directly, and expects a real `boxShadow` string —
 * not a global replacement of native shadow behavior, just the
 * platform-appropriate equivalent for the platform that actually wants it.
 * `react-native`'s own `ViewStyle` type doesn't declare `boxShadow` (that's
 * a react-native-web addition), so this is asserted for just this one
 * object rather than widening the shared style types app-wide.
